# Number Guessing Game

## Description
The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple interactive Python game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides hints to guide the user toward the correct answer.

## Features
- User-defined range for number selection.
- Random number generation.
- Unlimited attempts with hints after each guess.
- Input validation to ensure correct data entry.
- Score tracking based on the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.

## Installation
To run the game, you need Python installed on your system. If you haven't installed Python, download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Play
1. Run the script using Python:
   ```sh
   python number_guessing_game.py
   ```
2. Enter an upper limit for the number range.
3. The program will randomly select a number within the given range.
4. Try to guess the correct number, and receive hints on whether your guess is too high or too low.
5. The game continues until you guess correctly, and then displays the number of attempts taken.

## Example Output
```
Enter a number: 50
Guess a number: 25
You guessed higher number!
Guess a number: 10
You guessed lower number!
Guess a number: 15
You guessed right number!
You got it in 3 guesses.
```

## Future Enhancements
Planned improvements for future versions:
- Implement a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) to restrict the number of attempts.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt.
- Store high scores for replayability.
- Add a timer to track how quickly the user guesses the number.
